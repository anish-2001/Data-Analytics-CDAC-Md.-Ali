# what are pandas?
# Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
# It provides data structures like Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D) to work with structured data efficiently.

# Example usage:
import pandas as pd

# series example
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
series = pd.Series(data)
print("Series:\n", series)

print("_" * 60)

# integer payload to series
